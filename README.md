# Stock_Prediction_Sentiment_Analysis
This is a project of Forecasting DJIA index trend with news headlines using BERT and LSTM

The pipeline involves two steps, first step is preprocessing the two raw dataset,'Gaurdian_news' and 'Reuters', and combine into a single csv file containing all headlines 'Data.csv'

After preprocess, we develop two approach for doing sentiment analysis BERT and LSTM. They are independent to each other containing the whole pipeline.
You may run either/all of them to see the result. Makes sure the 'data.csv' and 'DJIA.csv' are placed in the same folder as ipynb file.
